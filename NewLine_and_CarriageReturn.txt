# Line Feed (NewLine) and Carriage Return

Carriage Return (CR)
A carriage return or cartridge return (CR) is a control character or mechanism used to reset a device's position to the beginning of a line of text. It is closely associated with the line feed and newline concepts.

Originally, the term "carriage return" referred to a mechanism or lever on a typewriter. For machines where the type element was fixed and the paper held in a moving carriage, this lever was operated after typing a line of text to cause the carriage to return to the far right so the type element would be aligned to the left side of the paper.

In computing, the carriage return is one of the control characters in ASCII code, Unicode. It commands a printer, or other output system such as the display of a system console, to move the position of the cursor to the first position on the same line. It was mostly used along with line feed (LF), a move to the next line, so that together they start a new line. Together, this sequence can be referred to as CRLF

Line Feed (New Line/LN)
Newline or end-of-line or EOL, line feed or line break is a control character that is used to signify the end of a line of text and the start of a new one. Text editors set this special character when pressing the <Enter> key. 

The concepts of line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR) are closely associated, and can be considered either separately or together.
